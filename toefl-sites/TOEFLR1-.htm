				There is a common expression in the English language referring to a blue moon. When people <br>

				references to this expression that date from the second half of the nineteenth century.<br>

			</p>
			<p class="mb-2">
				<mark>Line (5)</mark>The expression "a blue moon" has come to refer to the second full moon occurring in any given <br>
				calendar month. A second full moon is not called a blue moon because it is particularly blue or is any <br>
				different in hue from the first full moon of the month. Instead, it is called a blue moon because it is so<br>
				 rare. The moon needs a little more than 29 days to complete the cycle from full moon to full moon. <br>
				 Because every month except February has more than 29 days, every month will have at least one full <br>
				 <mark>(10)</mark> moon (except February, which will have a full moon unless there is a full moon at the very end of <br>
				 January and another full moon at the very beginning of March). It is on the occasion when a given <br>

			There is a common expression in the English language referring to a blue moon. When people <br>
			say that something happens “only once in a blue moon," they mean that it happens only very rarely, <br>
			once in a great while. This expression has been around for at least a century and a half; there are <br>
			references to this expression that date from the second half of the nineteenth century.<br>

		</p>
		<p class="mb-2">
			<mark>Line (5)</mark>The expression "a blue moon" has come to refer to the second full moon occurring in any given <br>
			calendar month. A second full moon is not called a blue moon because it is particularly blue or is any <br>
			different in hue from the first full moon of the month. Instead, it is called a blue moon because it is so<br>
			 rare. The moon needs a little more than 29 days to complete the cycle from full moon to full moon. <br>
			 Because every month except February has more than 29 days, every month will have at least one full <br>
			 <mark>(10)</mark> moon (except February, which will have a full moon unless there is a full moon at the very end of <br>
			 January and another full moon at the very beginning of March). It is on the occasion when a given <br>
			 calendar month has a second full moon that a blue moon occurs. This does not happen very often,<br> 
			 only three or four times in a decade.

		</p>
		<p class="mb-2">
			The blue moons of today are called blue moons because of their rarity and not because of their<br>
			<mark>(15)</mark>color; however, the expression "blue moon” may have come into existence in reference to unusual <br>
			 circumstances in which the moon actually appeared blue. Certain natural phenomena of gigantic <br>
			 proportions can actually change the appearance of the moon from Earth. The eruption of the<br> 
			 Krakatao volcano in 1883 left dust particles in the atmosphere, which clouded the sun and gave the<br>
			  moon a bluish tint. This particular occurrence of the blue moon may have given rise to the expression<br>
			  <mark>(20)</mark> that we use today. Another example occurred more than a century later. When Mount Pinatubo <br>
